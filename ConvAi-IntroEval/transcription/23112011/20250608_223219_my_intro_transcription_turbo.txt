[00:00 - 00:07] Hello, my name is Lokesh Kumar AR. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science

[00:07 - 00:13] Applications at IIT Madras and a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science at Hindustan

[00:13 - 00:22] University. I have maintained a CGPA of 9.64 at 19 years old and am fluent in both English

[00:22 - 00:28] and Tamil. My academic journey has given me a strong foundation in artificial intelligence,

[00:28 - 00:34] machine learning, and data analytics. I am passionate about building intelligent,

[00:34 - 00:39] human-aligned systems. Throughout my studies, I have earned several certifications,

[00:40 - 00:46] including GitHub Foundations, Data Literacy from Datacamp, Chad GPT, Intermediate,

[00:46 - 00:52] and Google Data Analytics specialization. I was honored with the Excellence in Academia Award

[00:52 - 00:59] and ranked second at Hindustan University for my academic performance. I love working on

[00:59 - 01:08] innovative projects. For example, my team and I won first place at AI Genesis and INNOTHON 2025.

[01:08 - 01:15] I have also built AI chatbots for data analysis and visualization, and I enjoy collaborating with

[01:15 - 01:23] others to bring ideas to life. Some of my key projects include ConvAi, a conversational AI system

[01:23 - 01:30] for automating forum filling and interviews using voice and AI. Project 11, a data-driven project

[01:30 - 01:37] focused on predictive analytics and automation. Face and QR attendance, an attendance management system

[01:37 - 01:44] using facial recognition and QR code technology. My technical skills include Python, machine learning,

[01:44 - 01:52] deep learning, prompt engineering, and data analysis. I am comfortable with tools like Git, GitHub,

[01:53 - 02:01] Jupyter, agentic AIs, VS Code, Excel, and Aden. I am also skilled in communication, problem solving,

[02:01 - 02:10] project planning, and teamwork. My domain expertise covers AI system, design, generative AI applications,

[02:10 - 02:16] and automation frameworks. I have interned at COTHON Solutions, where I worked on machine

[02:16 - 02:25] learning and deep learning algorithms such as CNN, linear regression, and MTCNN. This experience gave me

[02:25 - 02:31] hands-on exposure to real-world AI projects and strengthened my programming skills. Beyond academics,

[02:31 - 02:39] I am an active member of university coding and AI clubs, and I have organized and participated in various

[02:39 - 02:47] tech fests, hackathons, and social initiatives. In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, listening to music,

[02:48 - 02:56] and exploring new AI technologies. I see myself as an adaptive, structured thinker and a quick learner who thrives

[02:56 - 03:04] in innovative environments. I am currently seeking internships or entry-level roles in AI, ML, data science,

[03:04 - 03:10] or prompt engineering, and I am open to research collaborations. My career goal is to become a

[03:10 - 03:16] leading AI, ML engineer and contribute to the development of purposeful, agentic AI systems.

[03:16 - 03:22] I am open to working in Chennai, Bangalore, or remotely, and am willing to relocate for the right

[03:22 - 03:30] opportunity. I am comfortable with remote, hybrid, or on-site work environments, and for entry-level roles.

[03:30 - 03:38] My expected salary range is 8 rupees minus 12 LPA. Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself.
