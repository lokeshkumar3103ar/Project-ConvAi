RTX Log - Rating stream functions update - June 8, 2025 13:15

This update would make the profile_rating_stream and intro_rating_stream functions
also check roll number subdirectories when looking for existing ratings.

SUGGESTED CHANGES (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET):
======================================
1. Update profile_rating_stream function:
   - Change the glob pattern to also check in subdirectories
   - Current: recent_profile_files = list(RATINGS_DIR.glob("*profile_rating*.json"))
   - New: recent_profile_files = list(RATINGS_DIR.glob("**/*profile_rating*.json"))

2. Update intro_rating_stream function:
   - Change the glob pattern to also check in subdirectories
   - Current: recent_intro_files = list(RATINGS_DIR.glob("*intro_rating*.json"))
   - New: recent_intro_files = list(RATINGS_DIR.glob("**/*intro_rating*.json"))

3. Update get_rating_file function:
   - Check both the main directory and roll number subdirectories
   - Add code to look for the file in all subdirectories if not found in main directory

REASONING:
=========
Since we now save ratings in roll number subdirectories, the streaming endpoints
need to be updated to look in these subdirectories to find existing ratings.
The double asterisk (**) in the glob pattern means "search recursively in all subdirectories".

This change is recommended for a future update to ensure full compatibility with
the new directory structure.
