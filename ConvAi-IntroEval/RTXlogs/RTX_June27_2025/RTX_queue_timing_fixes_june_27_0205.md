# RTX Multi-User Queue Processing Timing Fixes Implementation

**Date:** June 27, 2025  
**Time:** 02:05 UTC  
**Component:** Queue Manager, Frontend Polling, LLM API Timeouts  
**Activity:** Critical Timeout Optimization for Multi-User Scenarios  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED AND TESTED  

## Problem Statement

The ConvAi-IntroEval system was failing under multi-user load (3+ concurrent users) due to inadequate timeout configurations. Users would get stuck in "processing" state and never receive results, causing system instability and poor user experience.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Frontend Polling Timeout**: 5 minutes was insufficient for realistic LLM processing times
2. **Backend STT Timeout**: 30 seconds was far too short for actual speech-to-text processing
3. **Backend Evaluation Timeout**: 60 seconds was insufficient for LLM evaluation tasks
4. **LLM API Calls**: No timeout parameters, causing indefinite hanging on unresponsive calls
5. **Time Estimates**: Unrealistic 45-second default estimates confused users

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Frontend Polling Timeout Extension
**File:** `static/js/app.js`
```javascript
// BEFORE
}, 300000); // 5 minutes

// AFTER  
}, 1200000); // 20 minutes
```
**Impact:** Users maintain connection during longer processing times in multi-user scenarios

### 2. Backend Queue Manager Timeout Increases
**File:** `app/llm/queue_manager.py`
```python
# BEFORE
self.stt_timeout = 30  # 30 seconds timeout per STT task
self.evaluation_timeout = 60  # 60 seconds timeout per evaluation

# AFTER
self.stt_timeout = 300  # 5 minutes timeout per STT task (was 30s)
self.evaluation_timeout = 600  # 10 minutes timeout per evaluation (was 60s)
```
**Impact:** Backend accommodates realistic LLM processing times without premature timeouts

### 3. LLM API Request Timeouts
**Files:** `app/llm/profile_rater_updated.py`, `app/llm/intro_rater_updated.py`, `app/llm/form_extractor.py`
```python
# BEFORE
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:11434/api/generate",
    json={...}
)

# AFTER
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:11434/api/generate",
    json={...},
    timeout=300  # 5 minutes timeout for LLM API call
)
```
**Impact:** Prevents indefinite hanging on unresponsive LLM server calls

### 4. Improved Time Estimation Logic
**File:** `app/llm/queue_manager.py`
```python
# BEFORE
avg_time = 45  # Default estimate in seconds

# AFTER
avg_time = 450  # Default estimate in seconds (7.5 minutes)
if completed_count > 0 and hasattr(self, '_processing_times'):
    calculated_avg = sum(self._processing_times) / len(self._processing_times)
    avg_time = max(180, calculated_avg)  # Minimum 3 minutes
```

**Enhanced Wait Time Calculation:**
```python
def get_estimated_wait_time(self, task_id: str) -> int:
    """Calculate realistic wait time based on queue position and current processing"""
    position = self.get_queue_position(task_id)
    if position is None or position <= 0:
        return 0
    
    # Use realistic time estimates based on actual processing data
    stats = self.get_stats()
    avg_processing_time = max(180, stats.get("average_processing_time", 450))  # Min 3 minutes
    
    # Calculate base wait time
    base_wait = (position - 1) * avg_processing_time
    
    # Add phase-specific adjustments
    current_phase = stats.get("current_phase", "idle")
    if current_phase == "stt_phase":
        base_wait += 120  # Add 2 minutes for STT completion
    elif current_phase == "evaluation_phase":
        base_wait += 300  # Add 5 minutes for evaluation completion
    
    return max(30, int(base_wait))  # Minimum 30 seconds
```
**Impact:** Much more accurate time estimates and queue position reporting

### 5. Enhanced Main Application Status Logic
**File:** `main.py`
```python
# BEFORE
estimated_wait_time = task_position * avg_processing_time

# AFTER
estimated_wait_time = queue_manager.get_estimated_wait_time(task_id)
```
**Impact:** Frontend receives sophisticated wait time calculations

## Validation and Testing
