Change Log for RTX on June 8, 2025

This file documents changes made to implement roll number-based folder organization
for videos, transcriptions, and ratings in the ConvAi-IntroEval application.

OVERVIEW
========
Modified the application to save files in user-specific subdirectories based on 
roll numbers within existing parent directories:
- /videos/{roll_number}/
- /transcription/{roll_number}/
- /ratings/{roll_number}/

CHANGES
=======
1. Added get_current_user function in auth.py
2. Modified transcribe_endpoint in main.py to create roll number subdirectories
3. Modified the transcribe_file function in stt.py to save in roll number subdirectories
4. Updated process_rating_background in main.py to save ratings in roll number subdirectories
5. Added roll_number to form paths in main.py

DETAILS
=======
Each function now checks for the current user's roll number and creates 
appropriate subdirectories as needed before saving files.

File paths have been updated throughout the application to reflect this
new organization structure.
