CHANGE DETAILS:
--------------
Final integration and testing of comprehensive roll number-based file organization system across ConvAi-IntroEval application

IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
---------------------
✅ Core Components Completed:
1. file_organizer.py - Central file organization and logging system
2. auth.py - Authentication with roll number extraction  
3. stt.py - Speech-to-text with organized transcription storage
4. app/llm/utils.py - Utility functions with file organization
5. app/llm/form_extractor.py - Form extraction with organized storage
6. main.py - Updated endpoints for complete integration

✅ Key Features Implemented:
- Automatic file organization by roll number subdirectories
- Comprehensive file operation logging with metadata
- Backward compatibility with existing files in root directories
