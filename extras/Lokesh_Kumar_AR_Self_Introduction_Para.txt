Hello, my name is Lokesh Kumar A R.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science &
Applications at IIT Madras and a Bachelor of Technology in Computer
Science at Hindustan University. I have maintained a CGPA of 9.64.
At 19 years old, and am fluent in both English
and Tamil. My academic journey has given me a strong foundation in
artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics. I am
passionate about building intelligent, human-aligned systems.

Throughout my studies, I have earned several certifications,
including GitHub Foundations, Data Literacy from DataCamp, ChatGPT
Intermediate, and Google Data Analytics Specialization. I was
honored with the Excellence in Academia Award and ranked 2nd at
Hindustan University for my academic performance.

I love working on innovative projects. For example, my team and I
won 1st place at AI Genesis and INNOTHON 2025. I have also built AI chatbots for data analysis and
visualization, and I enjoy collaborating with others to bring ideas
to life.
Some of my key projects include:
- ConvAI: A conversational AI system for automating form filling and interviews using voice and AI.
- Project11: A data-driven project focused on predictive analytics and automation.
- Face and QR Attendance: An attendance management system using facial recognition and QR code technology.

My technical skills include Python, machine learning, deep
learning, prompt engineering, and data analysis. I am comfortable
with tools like Git, GitHub, Jupyter, Agentic AI's, VsCode, Excel, n8n.
I am also skilled in communication, problem-solving, project
planning, and teamwork. My domain expertise covers AI system
design, generative AI applications, and automation frameworks.

I have interned at COTHON SOLUTIONS, where I worked on machine
learning and deep learning algorithms such as CNN, Linear
Regression, and MTCNN. This experience gave me hands-on exposure
to real-world AI projects and strengthened my programming skills.

Beyond academics, I am an active member of university coding and
AI clubs, and I have organized and participated in various tech
fests, hackathons, and social initiatives. In my free time, I
enjoy playing chess, listening to music, and exploring new AI
technologies.

I see myself as an adaptive, structured thinker and a quick
learner who thrives in innovative environments. I am currently
seeking internships or entry-level roles in AI/ML, data science,
or prompt engineering, and I am open to research collaborations.
My career goal is to become a leading AI/ML engineer and
contribute to the development of purposeful, agentic AI systems.
I am open to working in Chennai, Bangalore, or remotely, and am
willing to relocate for the right opportunity. I am comfortable
with remote, hybrid, or on-site work environments, and for
entry-level roles, my expected salary range is ₹8–12 LPA.

Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself!
