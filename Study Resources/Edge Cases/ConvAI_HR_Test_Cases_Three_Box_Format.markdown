# ConvAI Form Filler: HR Test Cases in Three-Box Format

This document provides **120 test cases** for the *ConvAI Form Filler* AI in the **HR** scenario, based on the updated form fields from `Form Fields.md` (dated May 20, 2025). Each test case uses a three-box format:
- **Left Box**: AI’s question and issue (e.g., vague input, noisy audio).
- **Middle Box**: Human’s response and solution (e.g., redirect, clarify).
- **Right Box**: Expected form fields filled (JSON-like, e.g., `{Name: "Arjun"}`).

The cases cover all form fields across **Personal Details**, **Education Background**, **Skills**, **Work Experience**, **Projects**, **Achievements & Activities**, and **Career Preferences**, addressing linguistic, emotional, technical, ethical, and extreme edge cases. The test cases align with the demo app (React, FastAPI, Mistral-7B, Whisper, MongoDB) on an NVIDIA RTX 4060, with hardcoded responses in `conversations.js`.
