Task: Fix remaining syntax and indentation errors after core runtime fixes

BACKGROUND:
- Core runtime errors (User object attribute access, save_file_with_organization parameters, 
  log_file_operation signature) were successfully resolved
- Remaining issues were syntax/formatting problems introduced during editing process

ISSUES FIXED:

1. **Malformed Comment/Code Combinations:**
   - Multiple instances of comments merged with code on same line
   - Pattern: "# comment text                code_statement"
   - Fixed by separating comments and code onto separate lines

2. **Indentation Issues:**
   - Fixed unexpected indentation errors throughout both files
   - Corrected try-except block structure misalignments
   - Fixed function definition indentation problems

3. **Specific Fixes Made:**

   **main.py:**
   - Line 311: Fixed "try:                log_info(...)" → proper separation
   - Line 314: Fixed "# comment                with open(...)" → proper separation  
   - Line 321: Fixed "datetime.now()...                    form_filename..." → proper separation
   - Line 323: Fixed malformed comment indentation
   - Line 396: Fixed "extract_roll_number...        user_info..." → proper separation
   - Line 412: Fixed "form_data = result            else:" → proper separation
   - Line 414: Fixed "form_data = None        except" → proper separation
   - Line 420: Fixed function definition indentation
   - Line 423: Fixed "file exists                if isinstance..." → proper separation
   - Line 434: Fixed "transcript_path)                        if not" → proper separation

   **form_extractor.py:**
   - Line 157: Fixed "# JSON file                json_data" → proper separation
   - Line 161: Fixed "}                    with open" → proper separation
   - Line 165: Fixed malformed comment/code combination
   - Line 253: Fixed incorrect indentation (14 spaces → 16 spaces)
   - Line 262: Fixed "saving data                yield" → proper separation
   - Line 267: Fixed similar malformed comment/code pattern
   - Fixed all corresponding indentation adjustments for try-except blocks

4. **Verification:**
   - Both files now compile successfully with python -m py_compile
   - VS Code reports no syntax or indentation errors
   - All functions maintain proper structure and logic flow

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ All runtime errors resolved (User object access, file operations, function signatures)
✅ All syntax errors fixed (malformed comments, indentation issues)
✅ Files compile without errors
✅ VS Code error panel shows no issues

NEXT STEPS:
- Application should now run without critical runtime or syntax errors
- Can proceed with testing actual functionality
- Ready for user testing and validation

FILES MODIFIED:
- main.py (multiple syntax/indentation fixes)
- app/llm/form_extractor.py (multiple syntax/indentation fixes)

RESOLUTION: All critical syntax and indentation issues have been successfully resolved.
The ConvAi-IntroEval application should now be free of compilation errors.
