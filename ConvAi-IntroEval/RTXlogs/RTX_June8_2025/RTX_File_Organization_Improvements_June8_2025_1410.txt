RTX Log - File Organization Improvements - June 8, 2025 14:10

SUMMARY OF CHANGES:
------------------
Improved the file organization system to correctly handle roll number-based subdirectories with better validation and error handling.

IMPLEMENTED IMPROVEMENTS:
-----------------------
1. Fixed roll number extraction:
   - Enhanced extract_roll_number_from_path function to avoid false positives
   - Added validation to prevent common directory names (like 'transcription') from being treated as roll numbers
   - Added pattern-based validation to recognize roll numbers starting with department prefixes (STU, CSE, etc.)

2. Improved file organization robustness:
   - Better handling of edge cases in get_user_directory
   - Enhanced save_file_with_organization to provide better error handling and logging
   - Fixed glob_with_roll_number to correctly find files in both root and roll number subdirectories

3. Better integration with the application:
   - Updated app/llm/utils.py to correctly handle files in roll number subdirectories
   - Enhanced save_rating_to_file to ensure consistent organization

4. Validation through testing:
   - Created test_file_organizer.py to test individual functions
   - Created test_application_flow.py to simulate the entire application flow
   - Verified that files are correctly organized and can be found across the entire workflow

RESULTS:
-------
1. Files are now consistently saved in roll number subdirectories when a roll number is available
2. Search functions can find files in both the root directory and roll number subdirectories
3. Roll number extraction is more reliable, avoiding false positives on common directory names
4. The system gracefully handles missing roll numbers, falling back to the root directory

The implementation has been thoroughly tested and is ready for production use.
