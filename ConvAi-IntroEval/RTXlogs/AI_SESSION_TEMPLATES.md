# AI Session Starter Templates

## For New AI Sessions:
```
Before we start, please read RTXlogs/AI_CONTEXT_PROTOCOL.md to understand the project context and RTX logging protocol. Then check the latest RTX log in RTXlogs/ to see current project status.
```

## For RTX Logging:
```
RTX time - please create/update today's RTX log before we proceed with any coding.
```

## For Quick Status Check:
```
Read the AI context protocol and tell me the current project status and what was last accomplished.
```

## For Resuming Work:
```
Read RTXlogs/AI_CONTEXT_PROTOCOL.md and the latest RTX log, then help me continue where we left off.
```

Copy and paste these as needed for new AI conversations.
