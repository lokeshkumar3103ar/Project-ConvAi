RTX Log - Transcribe Endpoint Integration Updates

CHANGE DETAILS:
--------------
Modified main.py: Updated transcribe endpoint call to pass roll_number parameter for file organization

BEFORE:
------
# In /transcribe endpoint
extracted_data = extract_fields_from_transcript(transcript_content)

AFTER:
-----
# In /transcribe endpoint  
extracted_data = extract_fields_from_transcript(transcript_content, roll_number)

PURPOSE:
-------
- Integrate roll number-based file organization in main transcribe workflow
- Ensure consistency between streaming and non-streaming form extraction
- Enable automatic organization of extracted forms by student roll number
- Maintain unified file organization across all application endpoints

RELATED COMPONENTS:
-----------------
- app/llm/form_extractor.py: Updated extract_fields_from_transcript() function signature
- file_organizer.py: Provides roll number-based organization functionality
- /extract-fields-stream endpoint: Uses same organization pattern for consistency
- Directory structure: All extracted forms now organized by roll number when available
