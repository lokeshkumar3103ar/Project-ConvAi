RTX Log - Improved File Organization Solution - June 8, 2025 13:35

SOLUTION OVERVIEW:
-----------------
Create a new utility module (file_organizer.py) that centralizes all file organization logic, making it more robust and easier to maintain.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
---------------------
1. Create a new file_organizer.py module with these functions:
   - get_user_directory(base_dir, roll_number): Creates and returns user directory
   - organize_path(base_path, filename, roll_number): Creates full path with roll number
   - extract_roll_number_from_path(path): Extracts roll number from file path
   - save_file_with_organization(content, base_dir, filename, roll_number, file_type)

2. Update main.py to use these utility functions consistently
   - Replace all file path construction with calls to the utility functions
   - Add detailed logging for directory creation and file paths

3. Modify transcribe_file in stt.py to use the new utility functions

4. Update profile_rating_stream and intro_rating_stream to also look in subdirectories

ADVANTAGES:
----------
1. Centralized logic: All file organization in one place
2. Better error handling: Consistent handling of missing roll numbers
3. More logging: Detailed information about where files are saved
4. More consistent: Same approach for all file types

This solution should fix the current issues and make the system more maintainable.
