RTX Log - Logging System Improvement - June 8, 2025 13:20

CHANGE DETAILS:
--------------
Modified: RTXlogs directory structure to use date-based subfolders

BEFORE:
------
- All log files were stored directly in the RTXlogs directory
- No clear organization for logs created on different dates
- Potential for file clutter as more logs are added

AFTER:
-----
- Created date-based subfolders with format: RTX_[Month][Day]_[Year]
- Moved existing logs into appropriate date subfolder
- Added README.md explaining the logging structure
- Created log_template.txt for consistent log formatting

Directory structure:
RTXlogs/
├── README.md
├── log_template.txt
└── RTX_June8_2025/
    ├── RTX_auth_changes_June8_2025_1245.txt
    ├── RTX_form_extraction_changes_June8_2025_1300.txt
    ├── RTX_Future_Rating_Stream_Updates_June8_2025_1315.txt
    ├── RTX_June8_2025_1240.txt
    ├── RTX_process_rating_background_changes_June8_2025_1305.txt
    ├── RTX_stt_changes_June8_2025_1250.txt
    ├── RTX_Summary_All_Changes_June8_2025_1310.txt
    └── RTX_transcribe_call_changes_June8_2025_1255.txt

PURPOSE:
-------
This change improves the organization of log files by:
1. Grouping logs by date for easier navigation
2. Preventing clutter in the main RTXlogs directory
3. Providing clear documentation on the logging system
4. Establishing a consistent format for future logs

This organization will make it easier to track changes over time and 
find specific logs when troubleshooting is needed.
