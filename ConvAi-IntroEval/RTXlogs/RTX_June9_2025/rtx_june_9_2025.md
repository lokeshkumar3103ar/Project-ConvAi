**ConvAI-IntroEval Rating File Handling Fix**

## Summary
Fixed two related issues with the rating file handling system:

1. The `check_rating_status` endpoint was not finding rating files in roll number subdirectories.
2. The `get_rating_file` endpoint was unable to retrieve rating files from roll number subdirectories, causing 404 errors in the frontend.

## Files Modified
- `main.py` - Updated both `check_rating_status` and `get_rating_file` functions to correctly handle files in roll number subdirectories.

## Issues Identified
1. The polling mechanism was continuously checking for rating status but returning "None" because it was only looking in the root ratings directory and not in the roll number subdirectories where the rating files are now being saved.
2. Even after the first issue was fixed, the frontend was getting 404 errors when trying to load the rating files because the `get_rating_file` endpoint couldn't find them in the subdirectories.

## Changes Made
### In `check_rating_status` function:
- ✅ Changed `RATINGS_DIR.glob("*.json")` to use `glob_with_roll_number(RATINGS_DIR, "*.json")` to search in both root and roll number subdirectories
- ✅ Added `filepath` field to the `recent_ratings` dictionary to keep track of full file paths
- ✅ Updated code to use file paths instead of just filenames for identifying the most recent files
- ✅ Simplified file validation logic when searching for form-specific ratings
- ✅ Added proper Path name extraction for API responses

### In `get_rating_file` function:
- ✅ Enhanced file search logic using `glob_with_roll_number` to look in both root and roll number subdirectories
- ✅ Added a fallback search with a more robust wildcard pattern when the exact filename isn't found
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging for file not found cases
- ✅ Fixed filepath handling in the JSON response

## Testing Results
After implementing these changes:
1. The `check_rating_status` endpoint correctly finds rating files in roll number subdirectories.
2. The `get_rating_file` endpoint can now successfully retrieve rating files from roll number subdirectories.
3. The frontend properly displays the rating data for files stored in roll number subdirectories.

## Current System State
The system now correctly handles rating files in both the root ratings directory and roll number subdirectories throughout the entire workflow:
1. Files are saved in roll number subdirectories by the background process
2. The `check_rating_status` endpoint finds these files during polling
3. The `get_rating_file` endpoint successfully retrieves them when requested by the frontend
4. The frontend displays the rating data to the user

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding a periodic cleanup task to remove old rating files
- Implement a more efficient polling mechanism with WebSockets
- Add more comprehensive logging for debugging file organization issues
- Consider updating the frontend to handle and display potential errors more gracefully
