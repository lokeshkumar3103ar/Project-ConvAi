**START_HERE_AI.txt Update Documentation**

## Summary
Updated the START_HERE_AI.txt file to reflect the current RTX logging protocol with proper naming conventions and examples for future AI assistant sessions.

## Files Modified
- `START_HERE_AI.txt` - Updated logging protocol documentation

## Changes Made
### Updated Logging Protocol Section:
- ✅ Changed file naming pattern from `RTX_[component]_changes_[date]_[time].txt` to `RTX_[component]_[activity]_[monthname]_[day]_[time].md`
- ✅ Added specific examples of log file names:
  - `RTX_concurrency_discussion_june_9_1430.md`
  - `RTX_pipeline_implementation_june_9_1500.md`
  - `RTX_testing_results_june_9_1630.md`
- ✅ Enhanced description to include "discussions, decisions, analysis, and implementations"
- ✅ Updated special files section with topic-specific discussion logs
- ✅ Changed last updated date from June 8 to June 9, 2025

## Reason for Update
- Previous naming convention was inconsistent with actual usage
- Needed clear examples for future AI sessions to follow proper logging
- Markdown format (.md) is more suitable for structured logging than plain text (.txt)
- Activity-based naming provides better categorization than generic "changes"

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: Future AI sessions will follow standardized naming
2. **Clarity**: Clear examples prevent confusion about file naming
3. **Organization**: Activity-based categorization improves log searchability
4. **Documentation**: Better structure for technical discussions and implementations

## Current Status
**COMPLETED** - START_HERE_AI.txt now contains proper logging protocol documentation

## Notes
This update ensures continuity across AI sessions and maintains proper project documentation standards for the ConvAi-IntroEval system development.

**Status: COMPLETED**
