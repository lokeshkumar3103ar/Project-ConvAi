RTX Log - Implementation Updates - June 8, 2025 13:40

SUMMARY OF CHANGES:
------------------
Updated the application to fully utilize the file_organizer.py module for consistent file management and organization by roll number.

IMPLEMENTED CHANGES:
------------------
1. Updated main.py:
   - Added proper imports for file_organizer functions
   - Modified transcribe_endpoint to use file_organizer for video and form saving
   - Updated process_rating_background to use file_organizer for roll number extraction and rating file saving
   - Modified profile_rating_stream and intro_rating_stream to use glob_with_roll_number for searching files

2. Updated app/llm/utils.py:
   - Modified get_latest_form_file to search in roll number subdirectories using glob_with_roll_number
   - Modified get_latest_transcript_file to search in roll number subdirectories using glob_with_roll_number
   - Updated save_rating_to_file to use file_organizer functions for consistent file organization

BENEFITS:
--------
1. More consistent file handling across the application
2. Better roll number extraction with the improved extract_roll_number_from_path function
3. More reliable searching in both root and roll number subdirectories
4. Improved error handling with clear status messages
5. Code is now more maintainable with centralized file organization logic

PENDING TASKS:
------------
1. Thoroughly test the implementation with various scenarios:
   - Files with and without roll numbers
   - Files in both root and subdirectories
   - Edge cases like missing directories or invalid roll numbers

2. Update any remaining functions that handle files if issues are discovered during testing
