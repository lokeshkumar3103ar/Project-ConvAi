RTX Log - File Organization Issue - June 8, 2025 13:30

ISSUE DETAILS:
--------------
The roll number-based directory organization is not working as expected:

1. Files are being saved in the root directories instead of roll number subdirectories:
   - Transcription files: /transcription/20250608_125228_my_intro_transcription_turbo.txt
   - Form files: /filled_forms/form_20250608_125326.json
   - Rating files: /ratings/form_20250608_125326_profile_rating.json

2. Some files have unexpected paths:
   - Ratings are being saved as: /ratings/transcription/profile_rating_20250608_125339.json
   - This suggests the path building logic is incorrect

OBSERVATIONS:
------------
1. roll_number might be null when files are being processed
2. The path construction in process_rating_background may be incorrect
3. There might be an issue with authentication or obtaining the roll number

PLAN:
-----
1. Revert previous changes
2. Implement a more robust solution that:
   - Properly extracts and validates roll numbers
   - Has better error handling when roll_number is not available
   - Uses absolute paths consistently
   - Logs detailed information about path construction
