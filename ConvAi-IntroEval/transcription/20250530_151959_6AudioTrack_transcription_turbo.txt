[00:06 - 00:13] It was confirmed yesterday that Spectrum, the well-known chain of sandwich bars, is facing collapse.

[00:14 - 00:18] For the first few years, the company showed spectacular growth.

[00:19 - 00:23] But about three years ago, things started to go wrong.

[00:24 - 00:27] Profits began to fall, and it seems they've never recovered.

[00:27 - 00:35] With me, I have our business consultant, Adrian Gifford, to talk about what's gone wrong.

[00:35 - 00:36] Adrian, hi.

[00:37 - 00:37] Hello.

[00:38 - 00:40] So, is this the end for Spectrum?

[00:41 - 00:46] Not necessarily, no. It's possible that they'll find a buyer.

[00:47 - 00:51] I believe that one or two companies have expressed interest.

[00:51 - 00:57] But if they want to buy the chain, they'll have to make the move very soon.

[00:57 - 01:00] The deadline for offers is getting close.

[01:01 - 01:03] So, what exactly went wrong?

[01:03 - 01:07] Five years ago, they seemed such a strong brand.

[01:08 - 01:12] I think many people will wonder how they ended up like this.

[01:13 - 01:17] Well, I think it's a classic example of trying to do too much.

[01:17 - 01:20] Their first shop was really successful.

[01:21 - 01:24] People really liked the novelty fillings.

[01:24 - 01:29] And because the product was good, they didn't mind paying a fairly high price for it.

[01:30 - 01:35] So, then Spectrum's response was to try and open more and more branches.

[01:36 - 01:41] Three years ago, they opened over 20 new branches in one year.

[01:41 - 01:44] They just expanded too quickly.

[01:44 - 01:47] But surely expansion is a good thing.

[01:47 - 01:50] It's what all successful businesses want to do.

[01:51 - 01:52] Of course, yes.

[01:52 - 01:54] But it needs thought and planning.

[01:55 - 02:01] Quite often, a company will try and launch a new product on the back of some previous success.

[02:01 - 02:03] But it doesn't always work.

[02:03 - 02:07] I think Spectrum did this when they started offering pizzas.

[02:08 - 02:11] There's so much competition from big pizza restaurants.

[02:12 - 02:14] It was very unlikely to succeed.

[02:15 - 02:19] But it wasn't just because of one unsuccessful product, was it?

[02:20 - 02:23] They really seem to lose custom in general.

[02:23 - 02:30] Yes, because another thing that happens when a company expands too quickly is that the quality suffers.

[02:31 - 02:33] And they lose that attention to detail.

[02:34 - 02:42] For example, in this case, I think one big mistake was that they started to use frozen ingredients in the pizzas.

[02:43 - 02:45] And even in some of the other products.

[02:46 - 02:48] One of their selling points before that was,

[02:48 - 02:50] We only use fresh ingredients.

[02:51 - 02:53] And that was why people liked them.

[02:54 - 02:54] Right.

[02:55 - 02:59] This is a mistake that even really big companies can make.

[03:00 - 03:03] Remember the famous case of Toyota in 2010,

[03:04 - 03:07] when they had to recall several million vehicles?

[03:07 - 03:11] That happened because the company focused on expansion

[03:11 - 03:14] and didn't pay enough attention to quality control.

[03:15 - 03:16] They actually admitted that.

[03:17 - 03:17] Hmm.

[03:18 - 03:22] So, what advice would you give to a company that wanted to expand?

[03:23 - 03:29] I'd say it's best to expand slowly and carefully and plan every step.

[03:30 - 03:35] Don't try to break into a new area without doing proper market research.

[03:35 - 03:41] Before you open a new branch, make sure all your current branches are profitable.

[03:42 - 03:47] And when you plan to open a new branch, always remember what makes your company special.

[03:47 - 03:49] Good advice, Adrian.

[03:49 - 03:50] Thank you.

[03:50 - 03:53] Thank you.

[03:53 - 03:54] Thank you.

[03:54 - 03:55] Thank you.

[03:55 - 03:56] Thank you.
