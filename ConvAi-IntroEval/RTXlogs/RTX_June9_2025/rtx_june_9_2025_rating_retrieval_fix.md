# RTX Log - Rating File Retrieval Fix - June 9, 2025

## ISSUE SUMMARY
Rating files were correctly saved in roll number subdirectories (e.g., `ratings/23112067/`) but were not properly retrieved and displayed in the web application. The application's `check_status` endpoint correctly found the rating files in roll number folders, but the frontend was receiving 404 errors when trying to load the files.

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
1. Enhanced the `get_rating_file` endpoint in `main.py`:
   - Improved file search by adding multiple pattern matching strategies
   - Added better error handling and detailed logging
   - Fixed how files are located in subdirectories
   - Added fallback search with different patterns to maximize the chance of finding files

2. Improved the `check_rating_status` function in `main.py`:
   - Added clearer variable names and improved logging
   - Enhanced handling of file paths and filenames
   - Added more detailed error reporting

3. Enhanced the `glob_with_roll_number` function in `file_organizer.py`:
   - Added better logging to track found files
   - Improved pattern handling for directory structures
   - Added special handling for patterns that already contain directory parts

## VERIFICATION
The fix has been verified by testing the application with existing rating files in roll number subdirectories:

1. The `check_rating_status` endpoint successfully finds and returns rating files from roll number subdirectories
2. The `get_rating_file` endpoint successfully retrieves individual rating files from these subdirectories
3. The frontend application correctly displays the rating files to the user

## CONCLUSION
The issue has been successfully resolved. Rating files are now properly retrieved from roll number subdirectories and displayed in the web application.

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
1. Consider implementing a periodic cleanup task for old rating files
2. Consider implementing a more efficient polling mechanism using WebSockets instead of regular HTTP polling
