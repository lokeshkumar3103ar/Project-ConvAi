=====================================

PRIORITY ISSUE TO FIX FIRST: Duplicate Rating Files in ratings/ Directory
------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Rating files are being saved twice, creating duplicates and inefficiency
- Good files (to keep): ratings/23112011/intro_rating_20250608_173544.json, ratings/23112011/profile_rating_20250608_173526.json
- Bad files (to remove/prevent): ratings/form_20250608_173248_profile_rating.json, ratings/20250608_173202_my_intro_transcription_turbo_intro_rating.json
- Root cause: Rating system saves files both in correct roll number folder AND main ratings directory
- Impact: Extra storage, reduced efficiency, code confusion

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:
1. Identify duplicate saving code locations
2. Fix code to prevent saving outside roll number folders  
3. Clean up existing duplicate files
4. Verify only roll-number-folder saving remains active

AFTER FIXING ABOVE: Teacher Dashboard Enhancement Implementation
--------------------------------------------------------------

TEACHER DASHBOARD REQUIREMENTS (/api/teacher/):
1. Add student analytics based on past performance
2. Display all student scores from roll number folders in ratings/
3. Enhanced student roll number click functionality to show:
   - All scores achieved by student (intro_rating + profile_rating)
   - Bar chart visualization of scores
   - Line progression chart showing performance over time  
   - Detailed ratings information

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
- Teacher dashboard exists: templates/teacher_dashboard.html
- Student list with roll numbers: ✓ Working
- Basic ratings display: ✓ Partially implemented
- Roll number folder structure: ✓ Exists (ratings/23112011/, ratings/23112064/)

RATING FILE STRUCTURE DISCOVERED:
- ratings/[roll_number]/intro_rating_[timestamp].json
- ratings/[roll_number]/profile_rating_[timestamp].json
- Each file contains: rating score, grading_explanation, insights, feedback, timestamps

SAMPLE DATA STRUCTURE:
intro_rating files: {"intro_rating": "8.5", "grading_explanation": {...}, "insights": [...], "feedback": [...]}
profile_rating files: {"profile_rating": "7.9", "grading_explanation": {...}, "grading_debug": {...}}

ENHANCEMENT PLAN POST-FIX:
1. Create new API endpoint: /api/student/analytics/{roll_number}
2. Enhance teacher_dashboard.html with chart libraries (Chart.js)
3. Add comprehensive analytics view with bar/line charts
4. Implement score aggregation and trend analysis
5. Update existing showStudentRatings() function for enhanced display

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Chart.js integration for visualizations
- Enhanced data processing in teacher_routes.py
- Responsive analytics dashboard design
- Historical performance tracking

FILES TO MODIFY (POST-FIX):
- teacher_routes.py: New analytics endpoint
- templates/teacher_dashboard.html: Enhanced UI with charts
- Possibly main.py: Route integration

CURRENT WORKFLOW:
1. FIRST: Fix duplicate rating file saving issue
2. THEN: Implement teacher dashboard enhancements
3. Log completion of both tasks

STATUS: STARTING WITH DUPLICATE FILE FIX
