**üìå Prompt to Perplexity Pro (or similar AI assistant):**

> We are building a **domain-specific AI system** for **form automation through human-like voice conversations** in HR and healthcare. The goal is to replace manual form-filling and interviews with a **natural, dynamic, voice-based AI agent** that understands context, asks follow-up questions, extracts structured data, and either fills hospital intake forms or evaluates job seekers.
>
> **We are seeking detailed research, guidance, and tools** to develop our own **lightweight, scalable LLM/NLP model** and pipeline focused on:
>
> ### üîç Areas of Research & Support Needed:
>
> 1. **LLM & NLP Foundation (Custom Model)**:
>
>    * How to train or fine-tune a lightweight domain-specific LLM (for HR and healthcare).
>    * Dataset preparation guidelines for conversational form filling.
>    * Approaches for building a retrieval-augmented model (for dynamic follow-ups).
>    * Benchmarks or pretrained models best suited for dynamic Q\&A, short-turn conversations, and contextual memory.
> 2. **Conversational AI Design**:
>
>    * Mapping between natural responses and structured form fields.
>    * Methods for maintaining multi-turn memory and context flow.
>    * Dynamic question generation based on user answers and missing fields.
>    * Conversational scoring systems (for HR evaluation).
> 3. **Speech-to-Text (STT) & Voice Processing**:
>
>    * Best open-source tools for accurate real-time STT (Whisper vs others).
>    * Optimizing latency and accuracy for real-time conversational UX.
>    * Architecture for combining STT input with dynamic NLP response generation.
> 4. **Machine Learning Architecture**:
>
>    * How to make the AI "self-learn" from failed conversations (adaptive retraining loop).
>    * Structuring user feedback and analytics to improve question flow and form completion.
>    * Confidence scoring, field prioritization, and ambiguity detection logic.
> 5. **Form Filling Engine**:
>
>    * Mapping free-form speech responses to pre-structured form templates.
>    * Handling missing, unclear, or ambiguous answers.
>    * Sample JSON schemas or form templates for HR and medical use cases.
> 6. **Deployment Stack**:
>
>    * How to deploy this system as a lightweight web app (React/Flutter + FastAPI/Node.js).
>    * How to host and optimize a small custom model on cloud or edge (low-latency).
>    * WebRTC or browser-based tools for real-time voice input.
> 7. **Testing & Edge Cases** (TBD):
>
>    * Frameworks to simulate real-world speech variation and test AI under stress.
>    * Tools for evaluating LLM response accuracy, hallucination, and failure modes.
>    * Suggestions for creating robust test cases and QA workflows.
>
> ### üì¶ Deliverables or Output Requested:
>
> * Concrete technical guides or GitHub repos relevant to each component.
> * Pretrained models or research papers on dynamic conversational form filling.
> * Suggested open datasets for HR interviews and patient intake scenarios.
> * Tools for fine-tuning or evaluating custom NLP models for task-specific language understanding.
> * Ethical considerations and user consent flows for data handling (esp. for healthcare).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Focus: Conversational NLP, self-learning loop, speech input, dynamic Q\&A, and context-based form automation.
